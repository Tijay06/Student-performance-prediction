# Student Prediction Model

## Overview
The **Student Prediction Model** project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict student performance based on various academic and demographic factors. This project showcases the implementation of multiple algorithms, allowing for a comparative analysis to identify the best-performing model for different datasets.

## Project Description
In this project, I explored a variety of machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks. Each model was trained and evaluated using several datasets containing features such as grades, attendance, socioeconomic background, and other relevant factors affecting student performance.

The primary objectives of the project are:
- To develop predictive models that can identify at-risk students early on.
- To compare the performance of different algorithms in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall.
- To provide actionable insights that can be used by educational institutions to enhance student support programs.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The datasets used for this project include various student performance metrics collected from educational institutions. The datasets contain features such as:
- Student demographics (age, gender, etc.)
- Academic performance (grades, attendance records)
- Socioeconomic factors (family background, parental education level)

The data was preprocessed to handle missing values, normalize features, and encode categorical variables.
